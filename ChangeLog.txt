02/04/08
--------
Joe -- Turned Testing mode on to temporarily fix all level loading bugs on Easy and Medium. Modified level 4_1 to include better puzzle element. Tweaked some levels in chapter 1.
Uncommented joystick controls now that I have one that works (Xbox 360 controller)

07/05/07
--------
Joe -- Completed remaining unfinished levels and fixed a bug in the gamelevel6_1.py code that would cause the game to display the Game Over screen immediately after the player spawned.

07/02/07
--------
Joe --
  Added code to take player back to previous levels if the player doesn't have enough bibles to complete the game (difficulty based). Added a game over window once the player beats the game. Previous 0.6 and 0.7 versions let the player cheat if he is clever enough to notice that the Bible and Banana count didn't reset if the player died on a level. The player could essentially pick up 4 bibles on a level, die, and pick those bibles up again to have a total of 8 thus beating the game by collecting bibles from only 1 leve.

07/02/07
--------
Joe --

8/7/2006
--------

01/23/2006
---------
Jari --
  Pressing enter starts a new game - also n works
  Enabled quitting by clicking the window x button while in menu. change in waitForKey()
  Added global variable Testing. When it is set to one the game behaves differently in following ways:
   - Game runs in windowed mode instead of fullscreen
   - Escape always quits to main menu instead of pausing the game (useful for quick quitting)
   - Dialog texts wont be shown in game but instead printed to console and the game continues normally
  Added exception handling for resource loading failures. You should now see a easily readable error message if loading of some graphic or level file fails
  Each level now uses a variable self.background as the background graphic file name. It is defined in the level's script class and the default value is "levelbg1h.png"
  Also level's level file name and tileset name is defined in the script class by variables levelName (default "level1_1") and tilesetName (default "commontiles"). Now we don't have to keep duplicate copies of files and file names are we're changed to more informing names

01/23/2006

11/12/2005
----------
Joe --
  Cut the menu function out of main.py and created menu.py and Turned on mouse.
  Edited base.py to wait for the 'n' key to be pressed to start the game.

  Changed version to 0.5.7

11/05/2005
----------
Matt --
  Modified the Hud to take up 1/4 of the screen. This will give us space to put text and stats.
  Scrolling in the tile editor was changed to mouse button 2
  Tiles can be selected in tile mode by pressing mouse 1 and background mode by pressing mouse 2.
  Moved level scripts to the levels directory.

11/04/2005
----------
Matt --
  Added an in-game tile editor. Adding new levels has not yet been implemented.
  Screen resolution was changed to 800x600. This allowed more screen space for tile editing however it slows down the speed of the game.
  BaseGameLevel is derived from Tilevid. Since the game level handles tiles and sprites this seemed appropriate.

11/1/2005
----------
Clint --
  Added some momentum to the player so that he slides around a little bit more, to give it a more interesting gameplay feel.
  Tweaked the starting levels some more.

10/31/2005
----------
Clint --
  Added generic levels for 1_x, 2_x and 3_x that levels can now inherit from
  Added the first of cave levels (2_1)
  Added level 1_2 which explains how Dave got into the cave
  Made main.py a little smarter as far as advancing levels when available
  Made Player.py copy its rect to the view_rect instead of direct-referencing it (fixes a small bug with earthquakes that way)

10/30/2005
----------
Matt --
  Derived the Player class from PGU's Sprite class.
  Losing a level kicks the player to the main screen instead of exiting the game.
  Animation is a bit more flexible. Each state can have a variable amount of frames and each state has its own time interval.
  You can now exit the game from the menu by pressing escape.

10/29/2005
----------
Clint --
  The HUD now doesn't display 0 Bibles, it only brings that up when there are Bibles collected.
  Added a rudimentary plane sprite
  Created a first version of the "first level", where Dave wakes up and walks around.
  Dave now climbs a rope properly, and isn't animated when he's stopped.

10/29/2005
----------
Vincent --
  Modified tileset to display waterfalls correctly
  Hide mousecursor
  Added a randomly generated tiled background
  Added background paralaxing


10/28/2005
----------
Clint --
  Added a basic Bible sprite
  Added the Bible sprite to the triggers, and edited basegamelevel.py to spawn Bibles when it hits that trigger.
  Added a num_bibles variable to the tilevid. This variable is incremented when a Bible is hit, and the HUD also looks at this value to display it in the upper-right corner of the screen.

10/26/2005
----------
Clint --
  Added an earthquake mode (see level 1_2 for an example)
  Restructured the class layout of the game, so that levels are now scripts which are dynamically loaded.
  Added functions to be overridden in custom levels, OnStart(), OnExit(), and OnRunSpecial1() through OnRunSpecial8()
  Added a HUD class to manage the heads-up display of the game.
  Dialogs now scroll the text letter-by-letter, handles newlines ('\n') characters properly, and when a line begins with a horizontal tab character ('\t'), it pauses and waits for the user to press a key before continuing.

10/25/2005
----------
Clint --
  Fixed some of the tabbing in main.py (make sure everyone uses tabs and not 4 spaces)
  Added a pause capability (temporarily triggered by ESC)
  Added background sprite animation (tried it a couple of ways, this way was the only one that worked).
  Removed import from menu.pyc -- it wasn't being used anyways.

10/21/2005
----------
Clint --
  Fixed jumping, so that you can no longer jump in mid-air if you have run off of a ledge.
  Added some comments to the code
  You can now no longer exit by jumping into a waterfall tile (which was the old method).
  Implemented the new sprites in the levels
  The win_block now uses a blank sprite, simply for collision purposes.
  The Start.bat now checks for various Python install directories, so that each person hopefully won't have to modify this file. Eventually, this should be made smarter.

10/18/2005
----------
Matt --
  Put the player code from game.py into player.py to separate some of the logic.
  Created a Player class that is easy to extend with more variables and methods.

10/17/2005
----------
Matt --
  Improved climbing by preventing side to side movement and locking Dave to the center of the tile.
  When falling, the walking animation is only played if a direction key is pressed.
  Max levels in an area is set to 4. The code automatically looks for the next level.
  Modified Dave's overall speed an jumping ability to improve the pace of the game.

10/17/2005
----------
Clint --
  Added many more graphics files, and added animation.
  To assist in the animation organization, added some globals to help us keep track of the character's state and direction. Changed the code accordingly. 
  Renamed yvel to dy to be consistent with dx. (though perhaps we should change both to xvel and yvel for clarity, as not everyone's taken calculus)

10/16/2005
----------
Clint -- 
  Moved all of the other functions in game.py to be within the Game class.
  Added many more comments. 
  Added a new sprite which looks a little better than my previous one.
  Also included the original Dave sprite. I'm not sure which one to use, but whatever -- both are there, and you can use whichever you like. :) 
  Added a new Win_Block sprite object, so now where you put a code 63 (3F or something), it will now spawn a little sign object which is your exit marker. Later, we can have this animated and spinning or glowing or whatever we want, but I think having it be a code in the map is the "proper" way to do it (rather than just having a trigger tile). 
  Modified the tile map so the pillars are no longer blocking.
  Slightly increased Dave's jump ability (from 13 to 14).
  Some level modifications (to use the new exit tile, as well as some major changes to level 1_2 to deal with Dave's new height but still lacking jumping capabilities.
